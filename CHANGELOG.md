## 0.2.3 — 2026-05-22

**Over-the-wire authoring lifecycle.** v0.2.0–v0.2.2 gave foreign MCP clients
a way to *observe* and *manage* running skills but not to *author* them
— pushing a new skill required filesystem access to the SkillStore root.
v0.2.3 closes that gap with three new MCP tools per Perry's design
(thread `f48b8ef3`).

### Added
- **`lint_skill({source?|name})` — 9th MCP tool.** Read-only. Returns
  diagnostics across tier 1/2/3, plus `passes_tier_1/2/3` booleans for
  cheap pass/fail checks. Accepts a literal source body (inner-loop
  iteration) or a stored skill name (re-validation).
- **`compile_skill({source?|name, inputs?})` — 10th MCP tool.** Read-only.
  Returns the rendered artifact + `target_order` + `resolved_variables`
  + warnings + errors. Compile failures land in the `errors` array
  rather than throwing, so cold authors get a diagnostic surface to
  iterate against instead of opaque tool failures.
- **`skill_write({name, source, overwrite?})` — 11th MCP tool, write.**
  Tier-1 lint runs at write time (SkillStore contract). Returns version
  + content_hash. Always lands as `Draft` — promote to `Approved` via
  the existing `skill_status` tool to enforce explicit-approval discipline.
  `overwrite` defaults to `false`; existing skills with the same name
  reject the write.

### Workflow
The cold-author flow over MCP becomes:
1. `lint_skill({source})` — fast feedback while drafting
2. `compile_skill({source, inputs})` — confirm the artifact looks right
3. `skill_write({name, source})` — commit to SkillStore as Draft
4. `skill_status({name, new_state: "Approved"})` — explicit deploy
5. `register_trigger({skill_name, source: "cron", name: "...")` — fire
6. `health_metrics({skills: [name]})` — observe fires

Six tools, one round-trip each, no filesystem dependency. The integration
test in `tests/v0.2.3.test.ts` exercises the full lifecycle end-to-end.

### Acknowledgments
Thanks to Perry for the three-tool bundle design (thread `f48b8ef3`),
turned around within an hour of the v0.2.2 ship.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-05-22

**Parser fixes from cold-author minion battery.** Perry ran 3 independent
cold-agent SDK authors against the stock-monitor exercise; they converged
on three parser failure modes. All three fixed in this patch — pure parser
changes, no runtime or dispatcher impact.

### Fixed
- **Bug A: `# Triggers:` comma-split breaks cron expressions with commas.**
  Hit by 3/3 cold authors. Cron syntax naturally has commas
  (`30,45 9 * * 1-5` = run at 9:30 and 9:45 on weekdays). The trigger header
  parser split on bare commas, mistakenly treating the cron-internal comma
  as a multi-trigger delimiter. Now splits at source-keyword boundaries
  (cron/session/event/agent-event/file-watch/sensor) instead — single-cron-
  with-commas parses as one trigger; multiple triggers still split correctly.
- **Bug B: Multi-line `~ prompt="..."` strings break the parser.** Hit by
  2/3 cold authors. The line-iterating parse loop treated interior newlines
  inside quoted kwarg values as block separators. Now a quote-aware pre-pass
  folds unclosed-quote continuations into a single logical line, and the op
  regexes (`~`, `>`, `&`) carry the `s` flag so `.` matches across newlines.
  Multi-paragraph LLM prompts now parse cleanly.

### Documented
- **`needs:` keyword forms.** Bug C audit confirmed the parser already
  supports all three syntactic forms (Make-style `target: dep1 dep2`,
  header form `target: needs: a, b, c`, body-line form `needs: dep`). The
  language reference now has a concrete `### Declaring target dependencies`
  example showing all three. v0.2.2 tests document supported syntax so
  future regressions surface.

### Acknowledgments
Thanks to Perry for the 3-minion cold-author battery (thread `a91db2e2`)
that surfaced these bugs in roughly an hour after v0.2.1 shipped.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-05-22

**Imperative-trigger surface fix.** v0.2.0 shipped with `register_trigger`
(via MCP) storing trigger registrations correctly but the scheduler's tick
loop was never armed inside `skillfile dashboard` — so no cron triggers
actually fired. Declarative `# Triggers:` headers had the same dormant
fate. v0.2.1 is the patch that makes the trigger surface load-bearing.
**Upgrade strongly recommended for anyone exercising the trigger APIs.**

### Fixed
- **Scheduler is now started in the dashboard host.** `cmdDashboard` calls
  `scheduler.start()` after wiring the registry, arming the 30s tick loop
  and the SIGINT/SIGTERM session-end hook.
- **Declarative `# Triggers:` headers register at boot.** The dashboard now
  walks the SkillStore at startup, parses each Approved skill, and registers
  every declared `# Triggers:` entry into the scheduler.

### Added
- **`runtime_capabilities` MCP tool** (8th built-in). Read-only discovery
  surface for cold agents — returns the wired connectors per kind
  (`skillStores`, `memoryStores`, `localModels`, `mcpConnectors`,
  `agentConnectors`), plus `shellExecution.mode` (structural-spawn vs
  bash-via-unsafe) and the runtime version. Optional per-category `include`
  filter.
- **`bootstrap()` + `defaultRegistry()` helpers** (`src/bootstrap.ts`).
  Extract the long-lived runtime host wiring — connector registry, scheduler,
  McpServer — into a single shared function so the v0.3 `serve`/`dashboard`
  split becomes a trivial new entry point rather than a refactor.
- **`Registry.list*()` enumeration methods.** `listSkillStores`,
  `listMemoryStores`, `listLocalModels`, `listMcpConnectors`,
  `listAgentConnectors` each return `Array<{ name, instance, ctor }>` for
  `runtime_capabilities` and future introspection use.

### Removed
- **`skillfile register-trigger` / `unregister-trigger` / `list-triggers`
  CLI commands.** These one-shot invocations each constructed a fresh
  in-memory Scheduler that died on process exit, making them no-ops in
  practice. The MCP tools (`register_trigger` / `unregister_trigger` /
  `list_triggers` against a live `skillfile dashboard`) are the canonical
  registration surface.

### Internal
- **CLI command surface tightened from 16 → 13 commands.** Help, dogfood
  fixture, and README updated.
- **`cmdRun`'s `buildRegistry()` collapsed to `defaultRegistry()`** —
  eliminates the duplicate registration logic between the one-shot run
  path and the long-lived dashboard host.
- **Dashboard now records traces by default** (`trace: { mode: "on" }`)
  so `fires` / `health_metrics` reflect the new tick-driven fires.

### Acknowledgments
Thanks to Perry for the cold-client MCP probe that surfaced the
imperative-trigger bug (thread `52f3d3d9-9212-49a9-b180-ae28fd1a7666`),
the structural-coupling diagnosis, and the `runtime_capabilities` design.
